The merge-csv.py file requires a file called 'data.csv'

Currently this is VERY hardcoded, but I thought it would be worth releasing:

preparation:
The script expects a 'data.csv' file and 'content4.xml.tmpl' file in the same directory

You will need to install Jinja:

   easy_install Jinja2

usage:

python merge-csv.py > content.xml

The result will be an ODT (openoffice style) content.xml file

Unzip an openoffice document and replace the content.xml with this one to get the merged output.
