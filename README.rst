Overview
-------------
This is an early proof of concept.
Currently this is VERY hardcoded, but I thought it would be worth releasing:
The merge-csv.py file requires a file called 'data.csv'

If you're comfortable with python and the commandline you should be able to find your way around.

Preparation:
--------------
The script expects a 'data.csv' file and 'content4.xml.tmpl' file in the same directory

You will need to install Jinja::

   easy_install Jinja2

Usage
----------
While in the directory with the 'data.csv' and 'content4.xml.tmpl' run the following::

   python merge-csv.py > content.xml

The result will be an ODT (openoffice style) content.xml file

This can be added to an unzipped openoffice document (ODT) to replace the content.xml, then rezip and rename to ODT. The resulting document will contain your merged output.

Utilties
-------------
In additon to merge-csv.py, there is also prettyprint.py which takes a content.xml file and outputs an easier to read version.
Pretty print is most oftent used on files generated by OpenOffice since they tend to save on white space at the expense of readability.
Still very badly coded, it takes no input and expects to be in the same directory as the content.xml file. 

usage::

   python prettyprint.py > cleanedupversion.xml
