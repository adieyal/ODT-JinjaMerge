Overview
-------------
This is a slightly better version of pigeonflight's (https://github.com/pigeonflight) mailmerge. It also converts the output to pdf which is something that I need.

If you're comfortable with python and the commandline you should be able to find your way around.

Preparation:
--------------
The script expects a 'data.csv' file and 'content4.xml.tmpl' file in the same directory

You will need to install Jinja and arg::

   sudo pip install Jinja2 arg

You will also need to run openoffice in server mode (for the pdf generation):
   soffice "--accept=socket,port=2002;urp;"&

About the openoffice template file
----------------------------------

This is a standard openoffice template file using Jinja style syntax for merge fields (I suspect  you can also do cool things like conditional stuff, loops etc but I haven't tested this)

Usage
----------
   python --template /path/to/odpfile --data /path/to/data.csv

The result will be an ODT and a PDF person in the data.csv (for the moment their is an implicit assumption that the csv file contains first_name and last_name fields although this is easy to remove)

Utilities
-------------
In additon to merge-csv.py, there is also prettyprint.py which takes a content.xml file and outputs an easier to read version.
Pretty print is most oftent used on files generated by OpenOffice since they tend to save on white space at the expense of readability.
Still very badly coded, it takes no input and expects to be in the same directory as the content.xml file. 

usage::

   python prettyprint.py > cleanedupversion.xml


-- I think this can probably be chucked
